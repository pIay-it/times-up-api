## <a id="game-queue-structure"></a>üîÑ Game Queue

A game's queue lists the order of passage of each team and players in them. Then, there is as much as game's queues than different teams among all players. As the game progresses, the queue rolls in order to keep the first element the next team to play. Same for the `players` field, the first player is the next `speaker`.
